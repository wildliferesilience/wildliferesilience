## Why care about resilience?

![](images/ForestType_Collage.png){fig-align="center"}

Resilient Sierra Nevada forests are healthy forests that can bounce back after disturbances like drought, fire, pests and disease. Ensuring forests are resilient is beneficial because they support/facilitate clean water, clean air, places to recreate, fire protection, and economic opportunities.

Naturally forests have evolved to be resilient but over the last decade, the increase in wildfire places much of Sierra Nevada at risk, such that disturbances may overwhelm their ability to respond. In the face of climate-driven increases in fire conditions exacerbated by a long history of forest fuel buildup due to fire suppression, federal and state governments, industry, forest communities and NGOs are all working together to increase the pace and scale of the restoration of forest resilience.

In California, both state and federal agencies are spending billions of dollars to manage forests for climate and fire resilience. But what does this resilience management mean for the conservation and enhancement of the state's wildlife?

## The link between forest resilience and biodiversity

Forests are very biodiverse, in fact, the world's forests harbor the vast majority of terrestrial species[@thestat2020b]. Species provide critical ecosystem services including: pollination, seed dispersal, and pest and disease control. Importantly, biodiversity provides the raw material for ecosystems to respond to change, bounce back or completely regenerate after a major disturbance.

## Definitions

**Resilience**: the ability of a community to maintain integrity/character after a disturbance.

**Biodiversity**: the variety of life, in all forms. This includes the variety of species, the interactions between these species, and other functions life performs in communities and ecosystems.

**Health**: communities that are supportive of a variety of ecological processes.

## Wildlife community resilience

One goal of conservation and management is to support the health and resilience of forested landscapes. Biodiversity is important for enhancing both. However, evaluating resilience alone or links between biodiversity, health and resilience is challenging. To address this challenge, the Wildlife Resilience Project is developing metrics to bring biodiversity and forest structure together to quantify and evaluate wildlife community health and resilience.

***Resilience is a dynamic process,*** below is a diagram that illustrates resilience in a complex system (green surface). As the system changes (for example, a forest grows), its current 'position' is defined by a ball traveling to different positions along the surface. Deeper 'troughs' represent increased resilience (forests that are less likely to transition). If a disturbance can push the system sufficiently far (e.g. push a ball out of a trough) (a large fire) then the system can move to a new state (follow the dashed arrow to the new trough on the right) (for example, a forest transitioning to a meadow or chaparral).

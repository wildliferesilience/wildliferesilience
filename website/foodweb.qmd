# Overview

Food webs are a valuable way to represent the complexity of interactions within a local wildlife community and simultaneously evaluate community health and resilience.

Species have a variety of interactions in wildlife communities (e.g., mutualistic, competitive, or trophic -- that is who is eating whom). Food webs illustrate the latter: Primary producers are at the bottom of the food web, followed by primary consumers, secondary consumers, tertiary consumers, and apex predators at the top.

However, food webs can get complicated fast. That's why it's important to describe the composition, structure, and function of the communities with summary measurements or *metrics*.

# Metrics

Three basic metrics include **guild richness**, and **functional** **dissimilarity**, vs **functional similarity**.

::: callout-tip
## Basic metrics

**Guild richness** describes how many different functional groups are present in a wildlife community. This is one way to describe biodiversity and health present in a community.

**Functional dissimilarity** describes the variety of functions present in a wildlife community. Communities with higher functional dissimilarity may support a higher diversity of ecosystem functions that in turn support ecosystem health.

**Functional similarity** (redundancy) describes how species perform similar functions within a wildlife community. Communities with higher functional redundancy are predicted to be more resilient to species loss.

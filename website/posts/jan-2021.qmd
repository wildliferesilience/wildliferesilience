## Getting started with the Metrics of Wildlife Resilience project!

Happy New Year! The [California Wildlife Conservation Board (WCB)](https://wcb.ca.gov/) funded our "Metrics of Wildlife Community Resilience for Sierra Nevada Forests." This support will make it possible to conduct a series of workshops, outreach meetings and importantly hire a post-doc to work with our team to develop the underlying theory, data and computer code to connect wildlife, plant communities and forest resilience. Thank you WCB!

## Field trip Caples vs Caldor fire assessing impact levels

<!-- add info here -->

Team members (Durrell Kapan, Jack Dumbacher, Pat Manley, and Rebecca Wilcox) toured the [Caples Creek Ecological Restoration Project](https://www.fs.usda.gov/detail/eldorado/landmanagement/?cid=fseprd553069) watershed to look at the different disturbance levels experienced with the 2019 Caples burn vs the 2021 Caldor wildfire.

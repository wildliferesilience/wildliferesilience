## Resources
The [Tahoe-Central Sierra Initiative](https://storymaps.arcgis.com/stories/df5a84c6ecd34f88a99328962eb33080) (TCSI) is led by state, federal, nonprofit, and private partners who are working together to restore the resilience of 1 million acres of Sierra Nevada forests and watersheds. The group's focus is to develop and demonstrate innovative planning, investment, and management tools.

In addition to developing an [Assessment of Current Landscape Conditions](https://www.fs.usda.gov/research/psw/understory/assessment-current-landscape-conditions-tahoe-central-sierra-initiative) and a [Blueprint for Resilience](https://www.fs.usda.gov/research/psw/understory/blueprint-resilience-tahoe-central-sierra-initiative), they created a Framework for Resilience - which promotes socio-ecological resilience across forested landscapes in the Sierra Nevada. Within this framework, they outline the 10 pillars of resilience (right). Each pillar describes a landscape benefit that is provided when a socio-ecological system is resilient. Our community food web work aims to contribute to the biodiversity conservation pillar, so that we can better understand how biodiversity contributes to resilient socio-ecological systems.

[Planscape](https://www.planscape.org/ "A decision support tool for planning to maximize wildfire resilience and ecological benefits") is an open source decision support tool to aid in management and planning to maximize ecological benefits and maximize wildfire resilience in California Forests Planscape is a collaboration of state, federal, and nonprofit partners to bring together the best available federal and state science and data to aid in regional planning and prioritizing landscape areas for treatment. Planscape presents data organized in the 10 pillars outlined in the Framework for resilience which was developed by the TCSI group.

The Planscape app provides a read-only ability to explore and build maps of data from the 10 pillars of resilience outlined in the TCSI framework for resilience.

### Collaborative groups in the Central Sierra

Community-based collaborations are a an important place for diverse stakeholders to work together to create fire-safe communities, sustainable local economies, and promote healthy and resilient forests. Here is a short list of such groups working in the Central Sierra:

[Lake Tahoe West](https://www.nationalforests.org/regional-programs/california-program/laketahoewest)

[South Fork American River (SOFAR) Cohesive Strategy](https://www.sofarcohesivestrategy.org/)

[North Yuba Partnership](https://www.yubaforest.org)

[Amador-Calaveras Consensus Group](https://www.acconsensus.org/)

### Resilience

For those who are interested in learning more about resilience: 

The Stockholm Resilience Center provides a description of, [what is resilience](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/research-news/2015-02-19-what-is-resilience.html)? And how to [apply resilience thinking](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/download/18.10119fc11455d3c557d6928/1459560241272/SRC%20Applying%20Resilience%20final.pdf). 

The [Resilience Alliance](https://www.resalliance.org/) works to advance "research and understanding on social-ecological systems for resilient and sustainable futures".

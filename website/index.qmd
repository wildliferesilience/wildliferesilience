# Wildlife Resilience

One goal of wildlife and forest management is to support the health and resilience of forested habitats, and biodiversity can be important for enhancing both. However, evaluating resilience alone or links between biodiversity, health and resilience can prove difficult. Therefore, our interdisciplinary group is developing metrics to quantify and evaluate wildlife community health and resilience.

## Definitions

**Resilience**: the ability of a community to maintain integrity/character after a disturbance.

**Biodiversity**: the variety of life, in all forms. This includes the variety of species, interactions between species, and communities.

**Health**: communities that are supportive of a variety of ecological processes.

## Why Care About Resilience?

Over the last 10+ years, the increase in wildfire places much of Western forests at risk. In the face of climate-driven increases in fire conditions exacerbated by a long history of forest fuel buildup due to fire suppression, state and federal government, along with industry, forest communities and NGOs are all working together to increase the pace and scale of the restoration of forest resilience. In California, both state and federal agencies are spending billions of dollars to manage forests for climate and fire resilience. But what does this resilience management mean for the conservation and enhancement of the state's wildlife?

## Why Care About Biodiversity?

The world's forests harbor the vast majority of terrestrial species (FAO 2020), therefore they are an important source of biodiversity worldwide. Species provide critical ecosystem services, including clean water, pollination, seed dispersal, and pest and disease control. Sierra Nevada forests are home to charismatic species, including mountain lions, fishers, martins, spotted owls, and goshawks. Healthy forests provide ample opportunities for bird watching, hunting, fishing, and other activities. More importantly, biodiversity provides the raw material for ecosystems to respond to change, bounce back or completely regenerate after a major disturbance.

Globally biodiversity is in crisis, therefore it is important to have integrative tools that better equip us to evaluate and support healthy, resilient, biodiverse communities as we plan major interventions to enhance forest resilience to fire.

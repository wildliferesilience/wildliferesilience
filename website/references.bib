  abstract  = {Biological communities are systems comprising collections of individuals of multiple species who interact with their environments, members
               of their own species, and those of others. Individuals interact competitively,
               trophically, and mutualistically, moving energy and matter through the system. The demographic, energetic, and chemical dynamics of the system are
               determined directly by the actions and properties of individual organisms
               within it and by the manner in which they are organized hierarchically into
               subsets of the community. The most obvious subset, or compartment, is
               the species population. Other subsets that affect system dynamics include
               functional groups, such as primary producers and decomposers, and the
               numbers of other species with which an individual typically interacts, such
               as specialist and generalist predators. Intraspecific interactions, within
               populations, are generally distinct in process and impact from interspecific
               interactionsâ€”for example, intraspecific competition versus interspecific
               trophic interactions.},

  abstract  = "Ongoing anthropogenic alterations of the biosphere have shifted
               emphasis in conservation biology from individual species to
               entire ecosystems. Modern measures of ecosystem change, however,
               lack the extended temporal scales necessary to forecast future
               change under increasingly stressful environmental conditions.
               Accordingly, the assessment and reconstruction of ecosystem
               dynamics during previous intervals of environmental stress and
               climate change in deep time has garnered increasing attention.
               The nature of the fossil record, though, raises questions about
               the difficulty of reconstructing paleocommunity and
               paleoecosystem-level dynamics. In this study, we assess the
               reliability of such reconstructions by simulating the
               fossilization of a highly threatened and disturbed modern
               ecosystem, a Caribbean coral reef. Using a high-resolution coral
               reef food web from Jamaica, we compare system structures of the
               modern and simulated fossil reefs, including guild richness and
               evenness, trophic level distribution, predator dietary breadth,
               food chain lengths, and modularity. Results indicate that
               despite the loss of species, guilds, and trophospecies
               interactions, particularly zooplankton and other soft-bodied
               organisms, the overall guild diversity, structure, and
               modularity of the reef ecosystem remained intact. These results
               have important implications for the integrity of fossil food web
               studies and coral reef conservation, demonstrating that fossil
               reef communities can be used to understand reef community
               dynamics during past regimes of environmental change.",

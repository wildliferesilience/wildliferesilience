## Why Care About Biodiversity

The world’s forests harbor the vast majority of terrestrial species (FAO 2020), therefore they are an
important source of biodiversity worldwide.
Species provide critical ecosystem services, including pollination, seed dispersal, and pest and disease
control.
Sierra Nevada forests are home to charismatic species, including mountain lions, fishers, martins, spotted
owls, and goshawks.
Healthy forests provide ample opportunities for bird watching, hunting, fishing, and other activities.

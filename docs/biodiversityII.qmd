Biodiversity: the variety of life, in all forms. This includes the variety of species, interactions between species, and communities.

## Why Care About Biodiversity

The world's forests harbor the vast majority of terrestrial species (FAO 2020), therefore they are an important source of biodiversity worldwide. Species provide critical ecosystem services, including pollination, seed dispersal, and pest and disease control. Sierra Nevada forests are home to charismatic species, including mountain lions, fishers, martins, spotted owls, and goshawks. Healthy forests provide ample opportunities for bird watching, hunting, fishing, and other activities.

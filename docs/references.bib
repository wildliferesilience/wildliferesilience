  abstract  = {Biological communities are systems comprising collections of individuals of multiple species who interact with their environments, members
               of their own species, and those of others. Individuals interact competitively,
               trophically, and mutualistically, moving energy and matter through the system. The demographic, energetic, and chemical dynamics of the system are
               determined directly by the actions and properties of individual organisms
               within it and by the manner in which they are organized hierarchically into
               subsets of the community. The most obvious subset, or compartment, is
               the species population. Other subsets that affect system dynamics include
               functional groups, such as primary producers and decomposers, and the
               numbers of other species with which an individual typically interacts, such
               as specialist and generalist predators. Intraspecific interactions, within
               populations, are generally distinct in process and impact from interspecific
               interactionsâ€”for example, intraspecific competition versus interspecific
               trophic interactions.},

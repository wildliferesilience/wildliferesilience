title: "Biodiversity"

**Biodiversity** is the variety of life, in all forms. This encompasses all different species from viruses, microbes, and fungi to plants and animals, the genetic information they contain, the variety of structures, forms, and functions they realize, and critically the roles they play in the communities and ecosystems they form.

Globally biodiversity is in crisis, therefore it is important to have integrative tools that better equip us to evaluate and support healthy, resilient, biodiverse communities as we plan major interventions to enhance forest resilience to fire.

###put in a table of classic biodiversity metrics

### describe types of biodiversity

### describe strengths of metrics describing these types

### describe shortcomings of these metrics

Next, utilizing biodiversity information (e.g. a list of species for a given locality), we work to construct [food webs](foodweb.qmd).

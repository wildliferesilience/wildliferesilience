## The project

In December of 2020 the [California Wildlife Conservation Board](https://wcb.ca.gov/) funded a planning and technical assistance project to develop "Metrics of Wildlife Community Resilience for Sierra Nevada Forests." This project allowed us to conduct a series of workshops, outreach meetings and underlying scientific, data and computational work to develop the links between wildlife, plant communities and forest resilience. We are using this site to communicate the resulting work the broadest audience possible.

### Overall Project Objectives

To develop metrics to assess the current and future resilience of forest wildlife communities to stressors associated with climate change that will help inform land managers how different management actions may influence wildlife community resilience into the future. These metrics will ultimately contribute to the management, conservation and restoration of Sierra Nevada wildlife communities.

### Questions for you

-   How would wildlife community resilience metrics be useful in your work and/or study system?
-   What would make them more useful to you? (e.g., specific scenario examples) -Any comments, questions, or suggestions?

## Food web metrics

![](images/ForestType_Collage.png){fig-align="center"}

***Evaluating food web metrics*** for wildlife communities across different forest types allows us to assess current conditions and predict how wildlife communities may respond to different stressors associated with environmental change. The following are a short list of example metrics and what they can tell us about the composition, structure, and resilience of a community.  

## Community composition

```{=html}
<!-- Three basic metrics include **guild richness**, and **functional** **dissimilarity**, vs **functional similarity**.

## Basic metrics

**Guild richness** describes how many different functional groups are present in a wildlife community. This is one way to describe biodiversity and health present in a community.

**Functional dissimilarity** describes the variety of functions present in a wildlife community. Communities with higher functional dissimilarity may support a higher diversity of ecosystem functions that in turn support ecosystem health.

**Functional similarity** (redundancy) describes how species perform similar functions within a wildlife community. Communities with higher functional redundancy are predicted to be more resilient to species loss.

**Species richness**, describes the number of species in a community.

***On the right, each dot is a species.***

Having more species is generally good, however, species richness alone does not necessarily mean that a community is more stable.

**Guild richness**, describes the number of guilds, or functional groups, present in the community. Guilds are groups of species who have similar predator, prey, habits, and body size.

***On the right, guilds are indicated by the large colored ovals.***

## Community structure and function

**Functional similarity**, describes how similar species are in their function within the food web (i.e., their predator and prey relationships). The inverse to similarity is dissimilarity. **Functional dissimilarity** describes how different species are in their functions within a community.

***For example, on the right , the two tertiary consumers (pink and purple) are very dissimilar in their predator prey interactions (colored arrows). We measure pairwise dissimilarity & similarity to calculate a metric for the whole community.***

Communities with high similarity (or redundancy) are considered to be more stable/resilient to random species loss. This is because if one species is lost then there is a high likelihood that there is another species in the community that will perform that role, and overall function will not decline.

If a community has a high functional dissimilarity that suggests that there is a high diversity of processes occurring within that community.

**Maximum chain length,** describes the number of links between a consumer species and a primary producer. 

Wildlife communities with long chain lengths, have top predators. These top predators can be more susceptible to anthropogenic change, and their loss may have cascading impacts on the rest of the community.

**Modularity,** describes the number of sub communities present in a community. 

***Sub communities are made up of species who tend to interact with each other more than with other species within the community (indicated by the blue and pink polygons).*** 

Communities with high modularity are hypothesized to be more stable and less vulnerable to random species loss because if a species is loss, it's impact is generally isolated to that subcommunity, and may not have cascading effects on the rest of the community.

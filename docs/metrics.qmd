Three basic metrics include **guild richness**, and **functional** **dissimilarity**, vs **functional similarity**.

## Basic metrics

**Guild richness** describes how many different functional groups are present in a wildlife community. This is one way to describe biodiversity and health present in a community.

**Functional dissimilarity** describes the variety of functions present in a wildlife community. Communities with higher functional dissimilarity may support a higher diversity of ecosystem functions that in turn support ecosystem health.

**Functional similarity** (redundancy) describes how species perform similar functions within a wildlife community. Communities with higher functional redundancy are predicted to be more resilient to species loss.

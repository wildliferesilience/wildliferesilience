    "text": "California forests are important cultural, economic, and ecological systems, however more than a century of fire suppression has only amplified the threats they face as climate change and other stressors snowball. In the face of these threats, one of the goals of forest management is to support the health and resilience of habitats. Resilience is the ability of a system to rebound and maintain its identity after a disturbance such as fire or warming temperatures, but what exactly does this mean for assemblages of thousands of interacting species?\nHistorically, measures of resilience have often focused on a few individual species or structural elements with inferred influence on the rest of the community. However, given that resilience is an emergent property of complex systems, considering all species (trees, mammals, birds, butterflies, etc.) and their interactions is critical to efforts that quantify resilience and our understanding of how wildlife communities will respond to different disturbances. Integrating biodiversity into plans for resilience will provide a more holistic picture of wildlife communities and will be critical for how we track, regenerate, and steward forests to be more resilient in an uncertain future with the compounding threats associated with climate change."

In the face of climate-driven increases in fire conditions exacerbated by a long history of forest fuel buildup due to fire suppression, federal and state governments, industry, forest communities and NGOs are all working together to increase the pace and scale of the restoration of forest resilience.

    "text": "Why Care About Biodiversity?\nThe world’s forests harbor the vast majority of terrestrial species2, therefore they are an important source of biodiversity worldwide. Species provide critical ecosystem services, including clean water, pollination, seed dispersal, and pest and disease control. Sierra Nevada forests are home to charismatic species, including mountain lions, fishers, martins, spotted owls, and goshawks. Healthy forests provide ample opportunities for bird watching, hunting, fishing, and other activities. More importantly, biodiversity provides the raw material for ecosystems to respond to change, bounce back or completely regenerate after a major disturbance.\nGlobally biodiversity is in crisis, therefore it is important to have integrative tools that better equip us to evaluate and support healthy, resilient, biodiverse communities as we plan major interventions to enhance forest resilience to fire.\nTo learn more, see food webs."

    "text": "Food webs are a valuable way to represent the complexity of interactions within a local wildlife community and simultaneously evaluate community health and resilience.\nSpecies have a variety of interactions in wildlife communities (e.g., mutualistic, competitive, or trophic – that is who is eating whom). Food webs illustrate the latter: Primary producers are at the bottom of the food web, followed by primary consumers, secondary consumers, tertiary consumers, and apex predators at the top.\nHowever, food webs can get complicated fast. That’s why it’s important to describe the composition, structure, and function of the communities with summary measurements or metrics.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA simple food web illustrating different feeding relationships.1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a global list of species that make up our communities: we create a terrestrial species that live and breed live in the central Sierra Nevada mountain range. This includes over 2,000 species of plants, invertebrates, mammals, reptiles, and birds.\nOn the right, each dot represents a species in an example community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nPlace species into guilds: for each species we collect information on their behaviors, habits, predators, prey, and body size. Using this information we place them into guilds with similar species.\nGuilds represent groups of species that are similar—and perform similar functions/jobs within the community. For example, lodgepole chipmunk and yellow-pine chipmunks are small mammals who have similar behaviors, diets, predators, prey, habitats, and body size and are placed into a guild together.\nOn the right, the large circles are guilds, and species (small circles) are each placed into a guild. The chipmunk species are examples of secondary consumers and would be in the large purple circle.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nAssign links between guilds—with extensive literature review and consulting with experts, we assign links between guilds to create a metanetwork.\nFor example, on the right, the arrows connecting the blue and green circles to the purple circle, indicates that chipmunks (purple circle) eat invertebrates (large blue circle) and seeds of plants (green circle). The arrows from the purple circle to the orange and yellow circles indicate that chipmunks can be eaten by weasels (orange circle) or mountain lion (yellow circle).\nThe metanetwork represents all potential interactions between species.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSublet the global list to a local community based on forest type—we crate habitat filters based on information on species habitat preference and occurrence. Using these habitat filters we can then subset the species to crate a metanetwork that represents all of the species (and their interactions) that can occur in a given forest type (seral stage & canopy density) at a given elevation.\nFor example, Sierran mixed conifer is the primary forest type in the Sierra Nevada. Yellow-pine chipmunks will occur, but lodgepole chipmunks will not.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nSimulate species level networks—from the metanetwork, we use a series of equations to estimate the links between each consumer species and their prey. This allows us to create a food web for the forest community. We do this hundreds of times because this helps us to capture the spatial and temporal variation inherent in species interactions."

    "text": "Wildlife diversity\nSierra Nevada forests are home to charismatic species, including mountain lions, fishers, martins, spotted owls, and goshawks. Forests that include many of these species and a variety of other species are recognized as healthy and biodiverse. But are they resilient?\nIt turns out that biodiversity is more than species diversity, it encompasses different levels of living diversity from variation within individuals (in behavior or physiology), to genetic variation within species, to differences between species, to the differences that distinguish the structure and function of entire ecological communities and ecosystems.\nOur work utilizes both classic biodiversity data (e.g. a list of species for a given locality, and if available their relative abundance) as well as information on the role or ‘jobs’ they perform in that location to move beyond classic metrics. Using these data we are constructing novel measures to characterize the functions diverse species in their communities. For more see food webs."

This is one way to describe biodiversity and health present in a community.\nFunctional dissimilarity describes the variety of functions present in a wildlife community. Communities with higher functional dissimilarity may support a higher diversity of ecosystem functions that in turn support ecosystem health.\nFunctional similarity (redundancy) describes how species perform similar functions within a wildlife community. Communities with higher functional redundancy are predicted to be more resilient to species loss."

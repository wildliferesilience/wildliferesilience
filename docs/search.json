    "text": "Sierra Nevada forests are important cultural, economic, and ecological systems, however more than a century of fire suppression has only amplified the threats they face as climate change and other stressors snowball. In the face of these threats, one of the goals of forest management is to support the health and resilience of habitats. Resilience is the ability of a system to rebound and maintain its identity after a disturbance such as fire or warming temperatures.\nMeasures of resilience often focus on a few individual species or structural elements with inferred influence on the rest of the community, but what about biodiversity? Inherently, we know that biodiversity and resilience are linked, but quantifying those connections can prove difficult. However, considering all species (trees, mammals, birds, butterflies, etc.) and their interactions is critical to efforts to quantify resilience and improve our ability to understand how wildlife communities will respond to disturbances in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrating biodiversity into plans for resilience management will provide a more holistic picture of wildlife communities and will be critical for how we track, regenerate, and steward forests to be more resilient into the future. To achieve this, our team from the United States Forest Services and the California Academy of Sciences is working to measure wildlife communities’ resilience by borrowing methods from paleontology1 to develop models of interacting wildlife species for different Sierra Nevada forests. This work is made possible by generous funding from the Wildlife Conservation Board2.\nThis website gives an overview of the basic background and process to create metrics of wildlife resilience for a large region in the central Sierra Nevada.

    "text": "Tahoe Central Sierra Intitiative\nThe Tahoe-Central Sierra Initiative (TCSI) working group’s landscape is a 1 million ha section of Central California forested land. The TCSI is home to a high diversity of vegetation communities, flora, and fauna.\nThe TCSI spans an elevational gradient from 210 - 3400 meters. From the Central Valley to the peaks of the Sierras, the TCSI spans five distinct life zones (i.e., biotic zones). Life zones are areas that have similar abiotic conditions (e.g., climate, soils, etc.), plants and animals. In the TCSI, life zones include: foothill woodland zone, lower montane forest zone, the upper montane forest zone, the subalpine forest zone, and the alpine zone.\nThere are 14 dominant vegetation types in the TCSI that vary in their occurrence (A) and density across the gradient (B).\n\n\n\nThe vegetation types that occur in the TCSI vary spatially (A) and in their occurrence at different elevations (B). Colors used for vegetation types in figure B correspond to vegetation type colors in figure A.\n\n\nConsidering wildlife communities at the scale of the Tahoe-Central Sierra Initiative landscape is critical because wildlife communities occur at large scales. Therefore, working at a spatial scale that encompass landscape level community processes (e.g., dispersal, connectivity, patch size, habitat diversity, neighborhood effects etc.) and disturbances (e.g., large fires, climate change, large scale management) can impact our evaluations of current communities and predictions into the future. Further working on the TCSI landscape is a fruitful enterprise because of the opportunities to collaborate and interact with an established group of stakeholders. The TCSI team has conducted a series of landscape scenarios (LANDIS II dynamic growth models) to explore how the area will change with climate change (2 pathways) and management scenarios (n=6)."

    "text": "Watershed studies\nExamining wildlife communities at the watershed scale is important because this is often the scale at which management (e.g. the application of prescribed fire or mechanical treatments) and disturbances (e.g., beetle kill, wildfire) occurs or can be adequately assessed. Furthermore, pre-existing data from multiple watersheds such as the Lake Tahoe basin and Caples Creek Watershed can be utilized to refine wildlife resilience metrics for specific forested ecosystems and disturbances.\n\nLake Tahoe basin\nLake Tahoe basin supports high biodiversity, including over 1,200 species of plants and animals. The basin also has a steep elevational gradient which means that it spans four life zones: lower montane, upper montane, subalpine, and alpine. Eight major vegetation types are common within the Lake Tahoe basin (A) and they range in their density across the elevational gradient (B3).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing the plants and animals that occur in those eight vegetation types, we’ve found that generally, overlap in species occurrence is more common for vegetation types in the same life zone. For example, (A) Jeffrey pine (JPN, orange circle), Sierran mixed conifer (SMC, dark green circle), and White fir (WFR, purple circle) forests are commonly found in the lower montane zone (B4) and they have high overlap in the types of plants and animal that occur in those forest types.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the different (and similar) species present in these different communities, we next use our food web models and metrics to see if communities differ in composition, structure, and function. To see what this looks like see the applications page.\n\n\nCaples Creek\nThe Caples Creek Ecological Restoration Project (Caples Project) is located in the Eldorado National Forest. Since 2017, project scientists from the USDA Forest Service & California Academy of Sciences have been studying forest health and resilience in mixed conifer forests at Caples. The team has been monitoring the avian and plant response to the intentional application of fire (the 2019 prescribed Caples fire), and are comparing this to a severe wildfire (the 2021 Caldor Fire).\nOur collaborative team has surveyed over 80 sites in the Caples Watershed each year gathering traditional avian point-count data as well as passive acoustic recordings, vegetation, and fuel measurements. The Caples Project provides a unique opportunity to contrast wildlife resilience metrics for forests treated with fire intentionally applied to enhance forest resilience with forests experiencing severe wildfire—providing a direct measure of the value of prescribed fire at the watershed scale and the effect of different fire severity on wildlife resilience.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoss of resilience and its recovery: Above, shows the loss of forest resilience due to burnable biomass buildup from our study area, the Caples creek watershed (top) and impact of controlled fire just outside the watershed (middle). After the Caples Fire, a variety of burn-severities create forest heterogeneity (bottom) that may increase forest resilience to factors promoting future fires © Durrell D.

Further working on the TCSI landscape is a fruitful enterprise because of the opportunities to collaborate and interact with an established group of stakeholders.

If a disturbance can push the system sufficiently far (e.g. push a ball out of a trough) (a large fire) then the system can move to a new state (follow the dashed arrow to the new trough on the right) (for example, a forest transitioning to a meadow or chaparral)."

The inverse to similarity is dissimilarity. Functional dissimilarity describes how different species are in their functions within a community.\nFor example, on the right , the two tertiary consumers (pink and purple) are very dissimilar in their predator prey interactions (colored arrows). We measure pairwise dissimilarity & similarity to calculate a metric for the whole community.\nCommunities with high similarity (or redundancy) are considered to be more stable/resilient to random species loss. This is because if one species is lost then there is a high likelihood that there is another species in the community that will perform that role, and overall function will not decline.\nIf a community has a high functional dissimilarity that suggests that there is a high diversity of processes occurring within that community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMaximum chain length, describes the number of links between a consumer species and a primary producer.\nWildlife communities with long chain lengths, have top predators.

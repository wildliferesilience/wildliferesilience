    "text": "California forests are important cultural, economic, and ecological systems, however more than a century of fire suppression has only amplified the threats they face as climate change and other stressors snowball. In the face of these threats, one of the goals of forest management is to support the health and resilience of habitats. Resilience is the ability of a system to rebound and maintain its identity after a disturbance such as fire or warming temperatures, but what exactly does this mean for assemblages of thousands of interacting species?\nHistorically, measures of resilience have often focused on a few individual species or structural elements with inferred influence on the rest of the community. However, given that resilience is an emergent property of complex systems, considering all species (trees, mammals, birds, butterflies, etc.) and their interactions is critical to efforts that quantify resilience and our understanding of how wildlife communities will respond to different disturbances. Integrating biodiversity into plans for resilience will provide a more holistic picture of wildlife communities and will be critical for how we track, regenerate, and steward forests to be more resilient in an uncertain future with the compounding threats associated with climate change."

    "text": "Tahoe Central Sierra Intitiative\nThe Tahoe-Central Sierra Initiative (TCSI) working group’s landscape is a 1 million ha section of Central California forested land. The TCSI is home to a high diversity of vegetation communities, flora, and fauna.\nThe TCSI spans an elevational gradient from 210 - 3400 meters. From the Central Valley to the peaks of the Sierras, the TCSI spans five distinct life zones (i.e., biotic zones). Life zones are areas that have similar abiotic conditions (e.g., climate, soils, etc.), plants and animals. In the TCSI, life zones include: foothill woodland zone, lower montane forest zone, the upper montane forest zone, the subalpine forest zone, and the alpine zone.\nThere are 14 dominant vegetation types in the TCSI that vary in their occurrence (A) and density across the gradient (B).\n\n\n\nThe vegetation types that occur in the TCSI vary spatially (A) and in their occurrence at different elevations (B). Colors used for vegetation types in figure B correspond to vegetation type colors in figure A.\n\n\nConsidering wildlife communities at the scale of the Tahoe-Central Sierra Initiative landscape is critical because wildlife communities occur at large scales. Therefore, working at a spatial scale that encompass landscape level community processes (e.g., dispersal, connectivity, patch size, habitat diversity, neighborhood effects etc.) and disturbances (e.g., large fires, climate change, large scale management) can impact our evaluations of current communities and predictions into the future. Further working on the TCSI landscape is a fruitful enterprise because of the opportunities to collaborate and interact with an established group of stakeholders. The TCSI team has conducted a series of landscape scenarios (LANDIS II dynamic growth models) to explore how the area will change with climate change (2 pathways) and management scenarios (n=6)."

    "text": "Watershed studies\nExamining wildlife communities at the watershed scale is important because this is often the scale at which management (e.g. the application of prescribed fire or mechanical treatments) and disturbances (e.g., beetle kill, wildfire) occurs or can be adequately assessed. Furthermore, pre-existing data from multiple watersheds such as the Lake Tahoe Basin and Caples Creek Watershed can be utilized to refine wildlife resilience metrics for specific forested ecosystems and disturbances.\n\nLake Tahoe Basin\nThe Lake Tahoe basin is one of our focal watersheds. Lake Tahoe basin is located between two biogeographic provinces, the Great Basin and the Sierra Nevada, and supports high biodiversity. There are over 1,200 species of plants and animals in the basin (LTWA). The basin also has a steep elevational gradient which means that it spans four life zones: lower montane, upper montane, subalpine, and alpine. Eight major vegetation types are common within the Lake Tahoe basin (A) and they range in their density across the elevational gradient (B).\n\n\n\nThe vegetation types that occur in the Lake Tahoe basin vary spatially (A) and in their occurrence at different elevations (B). Colors used for vegetation types in figure B correspond to vegetation type colors in figure A.\n\n\nWhen comparing the plants and animals that occur in those different vegetation types, we’ve found that generally, overlap in species occurrence is more common for vegetation types in the same life zone. For example, (A) Jeffrey pine (JPN, orange circle), Sierran mixed conifer (SMC, dark green circle), and White fir (WFR, purple circle) forests are commonly found in the lower montane zone (B) and they have high overlap in the types of plants and animal that occur in those forest types.\n\n\n\nIn this figure, each large circle is a vegetation type, and each small circle is a species (green vertebrates, gold plants). Lines connecting species to vegetation types indicate that the species occurs in that vegetation type. Species may occur in multiple vegetation types (have multiple connecting lines) or occur in one vegetation type.\n\n\n\n\nCaples Creek\nThe Caples Creek Ecological Restoration Project (Caples Project) is located in the Eldorado National Forest. Since 2017, project scientists from the USDA Forest Service & California Academy of Sciences have been studying forest health and resilience in mixed conifer forests at Caples. The team has been monitoring the avian and plant response to the intentional application of fire (the 2019 prescribed Caples fire), and are comparing this to a severe wildfire (the 2021 Caldor Fire). Our collaborative team has surveyed over 80 sites in the Caples Watershed each year gathering traditional avian point-count data as well as passive acoustic recordings, vegetation, and fuel measurements. The Caples Project provides a unique opportunity to contrast wildlife resilience metrics for forests treated with fire intentionally applied to enhance forest resilience with forests experiencing severe wildfire—providing a direct measure of the value of prescribed fire at the watershed scale and the effect of different fire severity on wildlife resilience.\n\n\n\nLoss of resilience and its recovery: Loss of forest resilience due to burnable biomass buildup here from our study area, the Caples creek watershed (top) and impact of controlled fire just outside the watershed (middle). After the Caples Fire, a variety of burn-severities create forest heterogeneity (bottom) that may increase forest resilience to factors promoting future fires © Durrell D.

    "text": "Metrics that quantify entire communities can provide useful information to track, manage and promote a system’s health, and its ability to be resistant in the face of disturbance and threats associated with climate change. \nOne of the first steps in applying these metrics is to measure them in systems we know well such as the Lake Tahoe basin. Doing so can help us to validate our metrics and their ability to quantify a system, and interpret the metrics such that we can learn more (make predictions) about how the systems may respond to perturbations.\nTwo main forest types in the Lake Tahoe basin (A) are Sierran mixed conifer (B) and red fir (C) forests. These two forests differ in species composition, historic fire regimes, elevational range, and climate. Sierran mixed conifer forest is the most widespread forest type in the basin, primarily occurs in the lower montane zone, and is characterized as a dynamic system, with high productivity, high dispersal (colonization), and a historically short fire rotation. Compared to Sierran mixed conifer forest, red fir forest is considered to be a static, low energy system, climate limited because it is primarily occurs in the upper montane zone (often above snow line),and it has a historically moderate fire rotation. The contrasting productivity and disturbance regimes of the systems could be critical to their futures as regional climate changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecies and guild richness\n\n\n\n\nSpecies (A) and guild richness (B - functional groups) are higher in Sierran mixed conifer forests compared to red fir forests. However, just because red fir forest is less biodiverse (less species & guild richness), doesn’t mean it’s less valuable, they are different.\nThe two forest types occur in different life zones and support some different species. For example, Clark’s nutcrackers are important seed dispersers of conifers, and they are found in higher elevation red fir forests. While Sierran mixed conifer forests are home stripped and spotted skunks, who are mesocarnivores, which can be important in maintaining food web stability.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure shows mean values (circles) with standard deviation (error bars) produced from 1000 simulations of species level networks for a Sierran mixed conifer forest, mid seral stage, moderate canopy cover at 1900 m of elevation (blue), and a red fir forest, mid seral stage, moderate canopy cover at 2150 m elevation (red).\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMaximum chain length\nWhile similar, on average maximum chain length (calculated as the mean guild maximum chain length (mcl)) is higher in Sierran mixed conifer compared to red fir forest. This suggests that SMC will be less resilient to the loss of top (apex) predators compared to red fir forests.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure shows, for consumer guilds, the mean guild values (dots) and boxplot produced from 1000 simulations of species level networks for a Sierran mixed conifer forest, mid seral stage, moderate canopy cover at 1900 m of elevation (blue), and a red fir forest, mid seral stage, moderate canopy cover at 2150 m elevation (red).\n\n\n\n \n\n\nModularity\nModularity is similar and generally high for both forest types – this can be good because it means that if a random species is lost, then their loss will is less likely to have cascading impacts on the rest of the community. However, high modularity can also occur when there has been a simplification of the system - such as the loss of top predators. This is the case for the central sierras, where predators including grizzly bears, wolves, and wolverines went extinct when westward expansion by pioneers occurred in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure shows mean values (circles) with standard deviation (error bars) produced from 1000 simulations of species level networks for a Sierran mixed conifer forest, mid seral stage, moderate canopy cover at 1900 m of elevation (blue), and a red fir forest, mid seral stage, moderate canopy cover at 2150 m elevation (red).\n\n\n\n \nFuture applications\nStructure vs composition: Evaluating how communities (composition) vary based on structure (canopy density and age) will be important for communicating to managers how best to manage for dynamic landscapes.\nLandscape scenarios: LANDIS II scenarios simulate how different management scenarios will impact future landscape composition. Evaluating how communities are impacted by different types of management will be critical to understand how decisions now can support resilient wildlife communities into the future.\nFood web scenarios: perturbing food webs in different scenarios can be a valuable tool to understand how communities may respond differentially to perturbations.\n\n\n\n:::"

While communities can be complex, basely, they are made six types of species (B): primary producers (green, e.g., plants), primary consumers (yellow, e.g., herbivorous invertebrates), secondary consumer (orange, e.g., omnivorous birds like quail), tertiary consumers (red, carnivores like foxes), and apex predators (purple, top carnivores like mountain lions). 1"

    "text": "Evaluating food web metrics for wildlife communities across different forest types allows us to assess current conditions and predict how wildlife communities may respond to different stressors associated with environmental change. The following are a short list of example metrics and what they can tell us about the composition, structure, and resilience of a community.  \n\nRichness\n\n\n\nSpecies richness, describes the number of species in a community. More species is generally good, however, species richness alone does not necessarily mean that a community is more stable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nGuild richness, describes the number of guilds, or functional groups, present in the community. Guilds are groups of species who have similar predator, prey, habits, and body size. Here, guilds are indicated by the large colored ovals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMore metrics\n\n\nFunctional similarity, describes how similar species are in their function within the food web (i.e., their predator and prey relationships - species one (pink links) to species two (purple links)). Communities with high similarity (or redundancy) are considered to be more stable/resilient to random species loss. This is because if one species is lost then there is a high likelihood that there is another species in the community that will perform that role, and overall function will not decline.\nThe inverse to similarity is dissimilarity. Functional dissimilarity describes how different species are in their functions within a community. If a community has a high functional dissimilarity that suggests that there is a high diversity of processes occurring within that community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nMaximum chain length, describes the number of links between a consumer species and a primary producer. Wildlife communities with long chain lengths, have top predators. These top predators can be more susceptible to anthropogenic change, and their loss may have cascading impacts on the rest of the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nModularity, describes the number of sub communities present in a community. Sub communities are made up of species who tend to interact with each other more than with other species within the community (indicated by the blue and pink polygons). Communities with high modularity are hypothesized to be more stable and less vulnerable to random species loss because if a species is loss, it’s impact is generally isolated to that subcommunity, and may not have cascading effects on the rest of the community.\nCurrently we are estimating food webs at multiple spatial scales in the Central Sierras with the potential for multiple applications relating to describing communities, management, and climate change."

    "text": "Why Care About Resilience?\nOver the last 10+ years, the increase in wildfire places much of Western forests at risk. In the face of climate-driven increases in fire conditions exacerbated by a long history of forest fuel buildup due to fire suppression, federal and state governments, industry, forest communities and NGOs are all working together to increase the pace and scale of the restoration of forest resilience. In California, both state and federal agencies are spending billions of dollars to manage forests for climate and fire resilience. But what does this resilience management mean for the conservation and enhancement of the state’s wildlife?"

Species provide critical ecosystem services, including clean water, pollination, seed dispersal, and pest and disease control. Importantly, biodiversity provides the raw material for ecosystems to respond to change, bounce back or completely regenerate after a major disturbance. Biodiversity is critical for ecosystem health.

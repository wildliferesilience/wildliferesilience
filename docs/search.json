    "text": "Sierra Nevada forests are important cultural, economic, and ecological systems. Fire, disease, pests, and drought are naturally occurring disturbances in these forests. However, more than a century of fire suppression and climate change has amplified the intensity and duration of these disturbances and threaten forests. In the face of these mega disturbances, one of the goals of forest management is to support the health and resilience of habitats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nResilience is the ability of an ecosystem to persist, rebound, or regenerate after disturbance.\n\n\nMeasures of resilience often focus on structural elements (e.g., tree density) or on a few individual species (e.g., top predators or keystone species) with inferred influence on the rest of the community, but what about biodiversity? Inherently, we know that biodiversity and resilience are linked, but quantifying those connections can prove difficult. Considering all species (trees, mammals, birds, butterflies, etc.) and their interactions is critical to efforts to quantify resilience and improve our ability to understand how wildlife communities will respond to disturbances in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrating biodiversity into plans for resilience management will provide a more holistic picture of wildlife communities and will be critical for how we track, regenerate, and steward forests to be more resilient into the future. To achieve this, our team from the United States Forest Service and the California Academy of Sciences is working to measure wildlife communities’ resilience by borrowing methods from paleontology1 to develop models of interacting wildlife species for different Sierra Nevada forests. This work is made possible by generous funding from the Wildlife Conservation Board2.\nThis website gives an overview of the basic background and process to create metrics of wildlife resilience for a large region in the central Sierra Nevada.

    "text": "Tahoe Central Sierra Intitiative\nThe Tahoe-Central Sierra Initiative (TCSI) working group’s landscape is a 1 million ha section of Central California forested land. The TCSI is home to a high diversity of vegetation communities, flora, and fauna.\nThe TCSI spans an elevational gradient from 210 - 3400 meters. From the Central Valley to the peaks of the Sierras, the TCSI spans five distinct life zones (i.e., biotic zones). Life zones are areas that have similar abiotic conditions (e.g., climate, soils, etc.), plants and animals. In the TCSI, life zones include: foothill woodland zone, lower montane forest zone, the upper montane forest zone, the subalpine forest zone, and the alpine zone.\nThere are 14 dominant vegetation types in the TCSI that vary in their occurrence (A) and density across the gradient (B).\n\n\n\nThe vegetation types that occur in the TCSI vary spatially (A) and in their occurrence at different elevations (B). Colors used for vegetation types in figure B correspond to vegetation type colors in figure A.\n\n\nConsidering wildlife communities at the scale of the Tahoe-Central Sierra Initiative landscape is critical because wildlife communities occur at large scales. Therefore, working at a spatial scale that encompass landscape level community processes (e.g., dispersal, connectivity, patch size, habitat diversity, neighborhood effects etc.) and disturbances (e.g., large fires, climate change, large scale management) can impact our evaluations of current communities and predictions into the future. Further working on the TCSI landscape is a fruitful enterprise because of the opportunities to collaborate and interact with an established group of stakeholders. The TCSI team has conducted a series of landscape scenarios (LANDIS II dynamic growth models) to explore how the area will change with climate change (2 pathways) and management scenarios (n=6)."

    "text": "Watershed studies\nExamining wildlife communities at the watershed scale is important because this is often the scale at which management (e.g. the application of prescribed fire or mechanical treatments) and disturbances (e.g., beetle kill, wildfire) occurs or can be adequately assessed. Furthermore, pre-existing data from multiple watersheds such as the Lake Tahoe basin and Caples Creek Watershed can be utilized to refine wildlife resilience metrics for specific forested ecosystems and disturbances.\n\nLake Tahoe basin\nLake Tahoe basin supports high biodiversity, including over 1,200 species of plants and animals. The basin also has a steep elevational gradient which means that it spans four life zones: lower montane, upper montane, subalpine, and alpine. Eight major vegetation types are common within the Lake Tahoe basin (A) and they range in their density across the elevational gradient (B3).\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing the plants and animals that occur in those eight vegetation types, we’ve found that generally, overlap in species occurrence is more common for vegetation types in the same life zone. For example, (A) Jeffrey pine (JPN, orange circle), Sierran mixed conifer (SMC, dark green circle), and White fir (WFR, purple circle) forests are commonly found in the lower montane zone (B4) and they have high overlap in the types of plants and animal that occur in those forest types.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the different (and similar) species present in these different communities, we next use our food web models and metrics to see if communities differ in composition, structure, and function. To see what this looks like see the applications page.\n\n\nCaples Creek\nThe Caples Creek Ecological Restoration Project (Caples Project) is located in the Eldorado National Forest. Since 2017, project scientists from the USDA Forest Service & California Academy of Sciences have been studying forest health and resilience in mixed conifer forests at Caples. The team has been monitoring the avian and plant response to the intentional application of fire (the 2019 prescribed Caples fire), and are comparing this to a severe wildfire (the 2021 Caldor Fire).\nOur collaborative team has surveyed over 80 sites in the Caples Watershed each year gathering traditional avian point-count data as well as passive acoustic recordings, vegetation, and fuel measurements. The Caples Project provides a unique opportunity to contrast wildlife resilience metrics for forests treated with fire intentionally applied to enhance forest resilience with forests experiencing severe wildfire—providing a direct measure of the value of prescribed fire at the watershed scale and the effect of different fire severity on wildlife resilience.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoss of resilience and its recovery: Above, shows the loss of forest resilience due to burnable biomass buildup from our study area, the Caples creek watershed (top) and impact of controlled fire just outside the watershed (middle). After the Caples Fire, a variety of burn-severities create forest heterogeneity (bottom) that may increase forest resilience to factors promoting future fires © Durrell D.

As climate warms, it is predicted that red fir forests will decline and likely transition to mixed conifer. Constructing food webs of these two forest wildlife communities that we know well has two goals: (1) validate our metrics, do metrics match our understanding of the system? Are we able to create metrics that measure the system holistically? (2) Determine if metrics are similar or different, doing so will provide insights into what may be into what structure and function may be lost."

We measure pairwise similarity to calculate a metric for the whole community.\nTake home: communities with high similarity (or redundancy) are considered to be more resilient to random species loss.

    "text": "Community structure and function\n\n\nFunctional similarity is generally alike in the two forests.2\nThis suggests that multiple species may perform similar functions and that this redundancy may allow communities to be more resilient in the face of random species loss.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nWhile similar, on average maximum chain length (calculated as the mean guild maximum chain length (mcl)) is higher in mixed conifer compared to red fir forest.3\nIn general longer chain lengths are associated with less stable systems, because the loss of a top (apex) predator can have cascading impacts on the rest of the community.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\nModularity is similar and generally high for both forest types.4\nHigh modularity (a high number of subcommunities) can be good because it means that if a random species is lost, then their loss will be less likely to have cascading impacts on the rest of the community. However, high modularity can also occur when there has been a simplification of the system - such as the loss of top predators. This is the case for the Central Sierra, where predators including grizzly bears and wolverines went extinct when westward expansion by pioneers occurred in the late 1800s and early 1900s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nOverall these metrics suggest that the wildlife communities in mixed conifer and fed fir forests differ in their composition, but are similar in structure which suggests that they will respond similarly to the loss of random species or top predators. But this is just the start, here we discussed resilience to species loss, but what about to other potential stressors (fire, drought, pests, disease, etc.). Further, using these metrics we can explore questions that address both basic ecological questions (e.g., what are the factors that drive community assembly, and how will they change into the future?) and applied questions (e.g., do wildlife communities differ in their resilience to different management strategies?), both of which will help us to inform management and policy makers to help promote healthy and resilient forests."

Further, the basin supports high biodiversity, including over 1,200 species of plants and animals and has a steep elevational gradient that spans four of the five lifezones. Eight major vegetation types are common within the Lake Tahoe basin (A) and they range in their density across the elevational gradient (B).3\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen comparing the plants and animals that occur in those eight vegetation types, we see that generally, overlap in species occurrence is more common for vegetation types in the same life zone. For example, (A) Jeffrey pine (JPN, orange circle), Sierran mixed conifer (SMC, dark green circle), and White fir (WFR, purple circle) forests are commonly found in the lower montane zone (B)4 and they have high overlap in the types of plants and animal that occur in those forest types.\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the different (and similar) species present in these forest communities, we next use our food web models and metrics to see if wildlife communities differ in composition, structure, and function.

The team has been monitoring the avian and plant response to the intentional application of fire (the 2019 prescribed Caples fire), and are comparing this to a severe wildfire (the 2021 Caldor Fire).\nOur collaborative team has surveyed over 80 sites in the Caples Watershed each year gathering traditional avian point-count data as well as passive acoustic recordings, vegetation, and fuel measurements. The Caples Project provides a unique opportunity to contrast wildlife resilience metrics for forests treated with fire intentionally applied to enhance forest resilience with forests experiencing severe wildfire—providing a direct measure of the value of prescribed fire at the watershed scale and the effect of different fire severity on wildlife resilience.\n\n\n\n\n\nLoss of resilience and its recovery: Above, shows the loss of forest resilience due to burnable biomass buildup from our study area, the Caples creek watershed (top) and impact of controlled fire just outside the watershed (middle).

    "text": "Sierra Nevada forests are important cultural, economic, and ecological systems. Fire, disease, pests, and drought are naturally occurring disturbances in these forests. However, more than a century of fire suppression and climate change has amplified the intensity and duration of these disturbances and threaten forests. In the face of these mega disturbances, one of the goals of forest management is to support the health and resilience of habitats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDefinition\n\n\n\nResilience is the ability of an ecosystem to persist, rebound, or regenerate after disturbance.\n\n\nMeasures of resilience often focus on structural elements (e.g., tree density) or on a few individual species (e.g., top predators or keystone species) with inferred influence on the rest of the community, but what about biodiversity? Inherently, we know that biodiversity and resilience are linked, but quantifying those connections can prove difficult. Considering all species (trees, mammals, birds, butterflies, etc.) and their interactions is critical to efforts to quantify resilience and improve our ability to understand how wildlife communities will respond to disturbances in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntegrating biodiversity into plans for resilience management will provide a more holistic picture of wildlife communities and will be critical for how we track, regenerate, and steward forests to be more resilient into the future. To achieve this, our team from the United States Forest Service and the California Academy of Sciences is working to measure wildlife communities’ resilience by borrowing methods from paleontology1 to develop models of interacting wildlife species for different Sierra Nevada forests. This work is made possible by generous funding from the Wildlife Conservation Board2.\nThis website gives an overview of the basic background and process to create metrics of wildlife resilience for a large region in the central Sierra Nevada.

As climate warms, it is predicted that red fir forests will decline and likely transition to mixed conifer. Constructing food webs of these two forest wildlife communities that we know well has two goals: (1) validate our metrics, do metrics match our understanding of the system?

    "text": "Rebecca, Becky, Pat and Angela toured forests in the TCSI landscape and the Lake Tahoe basin to observe the impacts of disturbances (e.g., fire) and management (mechanical vs hand thinning) on forest communities. The field trip started in the footprint of the Caldor fire where we observed the impacts of a recent, high severity fire. Next, we drove to Lake Tahoe where we observed the regeneration of shrubs and trees following the Angora fire. Lastly, we went to the McKinney Creek Management Unit to observe the impacts of mechanical and hand thinning treatments on stand structure and understory vegetation. Field trips like these are a critical time to step away from models and computers in order to gain perspective on what's happening in the forests. Further, it was a fruitful time to generate questions and predictions for how these various disturbances and treatments might differently impact food webs and wildlife community resilience.\n\n\n\nProject members co-PI Becky Estes (left), Post-doc Rebecca Wilcox (center) and co-PI Pat Manley (right)."
